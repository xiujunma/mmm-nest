Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, intimidation, or bullying in any form
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at `xiujun.ma@live.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
